                                We receive a lot of requests for Ethereum based networks with customizations on the
                                consensus protocol, throughput and gas modifications and wallet customizations.
                                Back in October 2017 together with the community of Auxilium, who are the altruistic

                                implementation with Proof of Stake and coin-age idea borrowed from Peercoin.

                                With further development of AEPoS we are solving the problems that many industry
                                projects: infrastructure complexity, wallets customization, transaction fees
                                customizations, transactions throughput and many others.
